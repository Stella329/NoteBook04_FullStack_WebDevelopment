Project includes the following points:

1. Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
2. Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
3. Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.
4. Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.
5. Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.
6. Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.
7. Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
8. If validations on a <form> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <form> cannot be submitted.
